def backward_propagation_with_dropout(X, Y, cache, keep_prob):
    """
    Implements the backward propagation of our baseline model to which we added dropout.

    Arguments:
    X -- input dataset, of shape (2, number of examples)
    Y -- "true" labels vector, of shape (output size, number of examples)
    cache -- cache output from forward_propagation_with_dropout()
    keep_prob - probability of keeping a neuron active during drop-out, scalar

    Returns:
    gradients -- A dictionary with the gradients with respect to each parameter, activation and pre-activation variables
