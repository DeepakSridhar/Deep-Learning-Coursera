def create_placeholders(n_x, n_y):
    """
    Creates the placeholders for the tensorflow session.

    Arguments:
    n_x -- scalar, size of an image vector (num_px * num_px = 64 * 64 * 3 = 12288)
    n_y -- scalar, number of classes (from 0 to 5, so -> 6)

    Returns:
    X -- placeholder for the data input, of shape [n_x, None] and dtype "float"
    Y -- placeholder for the input labels, of shape [n_y, None] and dtype "float"

    Tips:
    - You will use None because it let's us be flexible on the number of examples you will for the placeholders.
      In fact, the number of examples during test/train is different.
