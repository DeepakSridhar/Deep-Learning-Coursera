def yolo_eval(yolo_outputs, image_shape=(720., 1280.), max_boxes=10, score_threshold=.6, iou_threshold=.5):
    """
    Converts the output of YOLO encoding (a lot of boxes) to your predicted boxes along with their scores, box coordinates and classes.

    Arguments:
    yolo_outputs -- output of the encoding model (for image_shape of (608, 608, 3)), contains 4 tensors:
                    box_confidence: tensor of shape (None, 19, 19, 5, 1)
                    box_xy: tensor of shape (None, 19, 19, 5, 2)
                    box_wh: tensor of shape (None, 19, 19, 5, 2)
                    box_class_probs: tensor of shape (None, 19, 19, 5, 80)
    image_shape -- tensor of shape (2,) containing the input shape, in this notebook we use (608., 608.) (has to be float32 dtype)
    max_boxes -- integer, maximum number of predicted boxes you'd like
    score_threshold -- real value, if [ highest class probability score < threshold], then get rid of the corresponding box
    iou_threshold -- real value, "intersection over union" threshold used for NMS filtering

    Returns:
    scores -- tensor of shape (None, ), predicted score for each box
    boxes -- tensor of shape (None, 4), predicted box coordinates
    classes -- tensor of shape (None,), predicted class for each box
